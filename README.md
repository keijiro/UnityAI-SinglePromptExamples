## Unity AI Single Prompt Examples

This repository contains examples of game prototypes created primarily from a
single prompt. In practice, I still used a few follow-up prompts to fine-tune
details after the initial generation.

### Corgi And Wolves

![CorgiAndWolves](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/934dfe66-e582-4b82-a11d-6bda1f353a54)

A mini game where you place corgis to create a safe path for sheep to reach
their hut.

### Ninja Jump

![NinjaJump](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6048163f-7f7c-4cf1-8cb2-91b09b1e08cd)

A 2D infinite runner with only three controls: accelerate (Right Arrow), slow
down (Left Arrow), and jump (Up Arrow).

### Reflex Shooter

![ReflexShooter](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab6d2800-1f0a-44bf-8343-178e9294ab38)

A 2D shoot-'em-up where you cannot fire directly. Instead, you reflect enemy
bullets with a force barrier to destroy them.

[Prompt](ReflexShooter/Prompt.txt)

### Sum Ten

A falling-block game prototype where your goal is to combine blocks so their
total becomes ten.

(This is still a very rough prototype, and balancing it into something truly
fun remains a challenge.)
